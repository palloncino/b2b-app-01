1. DEMO app, login, routes and listing.
2. Can we be definitive in the description of models like User, and Products?
3. Is visitor, customer and admin (editor) a viable solution?
4. Is there a UI/UX design mock up?
5. Is the current FE architecture viable:
    - Dashboard/Homepage
    - Product listing
    - User management
    - Checkout (?)
    - Payments (Do we have third party preferences?)
    - Add missing steps
6. Is the API description correct? How is the backend going to adapt to the current API schema?
7. Are there business specific requirements that are missing in my design?
